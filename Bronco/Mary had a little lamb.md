The cell phone cleared all the input after 2 seconds. I had to send all my inputs very fast or at the same time

There was a API endpoint in js file, linked with the website. It can be found through source code. 
The API is mary/
<br>
The API receives input like this:
mary/123456789
Found the valid value for mary had a little lamb on a reddit post and checked the endpoint.
